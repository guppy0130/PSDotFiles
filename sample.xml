    <Detection>
        <!--
            Specifies the method used to detect the availability of the component

            Can be one of:
             - Automatic:   The default method when none is specified. Attempts to automatically
                            detect the component by retrieving the list of installed programs from
                            the Windows Registry and searching for a case insensitive wildcard match
                            against the component name. The matching logic can be customised via the
                            optional <MatchRegEx>, <MatchCase> and <MatchPattern> elements.
             - FindInPath:  Determines the availability based on the presence of a nominated binary
                            located in a directory found in the system's PATH. Defaults to searching
                            for a binary with the same name as the component directory but this can
                            be customised via the <FindBinary> element.
             - PathExists:  Determines the availability based on the existence of a nominated path
                            specified in the <TestPath> element. The path must be absolute and would
                            typically test that a file or directory exists. However, any absolute
                            path that corresponds to an available PowerShell provider is valid (see
                            Get-PSProvider for more details). As such, testing against a Registry
                            path or more esoteric data stores is valid (e.g. the Certificate store).
             - Static:      Use the availability state provided in the <Availability> element.

        <!--
            Automatic Method

            Selects either wildcard (default) or regular expression matching.

        <MatchRegEx>False</MatchRegEx>

        <!--
            Automatic Method

            Selects either case insensitive (default) or case sensitive matching.

        <MatchCase>False</MatchCase>

        <!--
            Automatic Method

            The pattern used for matching against the Windows Registry keys. If undefined or blank
            we'll match against any Registry key where the component name is a substring of the key.

            FindInPath Method

            Name of the binary to search for in the system's PATH with optional file extension.

        <!--
            Static Method

            Availability state to always return for this component per the below options.

            Can be one of:
             - Available:           The component was detected
             - Unavailable:         The component was not detected
             - Ignored:             The component will be ignored. This is distinct from the
                                    "Unavailable" state as it indicates the component is not
                                    available for the platform.
             - AlwaysInstall:       The component will always be installed
             - NeverInstall:        The component will never be installed
             - DetectionFailure:    A failure occurred during component detection
             - NoLogic:             No detection logic was available

    <InstallPath>
        <!--
            Specifies a special folder from the Environment.SpecialFolder enumeration

            This setting can be used in two ways to modify the destination for symlinking:
             - If no <Destination> is specified the component will be symlinked directly into the
               specified special folder.
             - If a <Destination> is specified it will be used as a *suffix* to the nominated
               special folder. That is, the <Destination> path is relative to the special folder.

            The default behaviour is particularly important to note:
             - If not specified the default is to use the "UserProfile" special folder ($HOME).
             - If a <Destination> folder is specified without a <SpecialFolder> then *no* special
               folder is used and <Destination> is considered to be an absolute path.

            See: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.specialfolder.aspx

        <!--
            Specifies an absolute or relative destination path subject to <SpecialFolder>

            This setting specifies an absolute or relative filesystem path as the destination for
            component symlinking. The path is considered absolute *only if* no <SpecialFolder> is
            specified. Otherwise, this path is considered to be relative to the special folder.

            If no <Destination> is specified then only the <SpecialFolder> path will be used.

        <!--
            Specifies whether component symlinks should be hidden by setting the "Hidden" and
