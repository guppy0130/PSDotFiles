    <Detection>
        <!--
            Specifies the method used to detect the availability of the component

            Can be one of:
             - Automatic:   The default method when none is specified. Attempts to automatically
                            detect the component by retrieving the list of installed programs from
                            the Windows Registry and searching for a case insensitive wildcard match
                            against the component name. The matching logic can be customised via the
                            optional MatchRegEx, MatchCase and MatchPattern elements.
             - Static:      Always use the availability state provided in the Availability element.

        <!-- Selects either wildcard (default) or regular expression matching -->
        <MatchRegEx>False</MatchRegEx>

        <!-- Selects either case insensitive (default) or case sensitive matching -->
        <MatchCase>False</MatchCase>

        <!--
            The pattern used for matching against the Windows Registry keys. If undefined or blank
            we'll match against any Registry key where the component name is a substring of the key.

        <MatchPattern></MatchPattern>

        <!--
            Only used when the detection method is "Static" in which case this is required

            Can be one of:
             - Available:           The component was detected
             - Unavailable:         The component was not detected
             - Ignored:             The component will be ignored. This is distinct from the
                                    "Unavailable" state as it indicates the component is not
                                    available for the platform.
             - AlwaysInstall:       The component will always be installed
             - NeverInstall:        The component will never be installed
             - DetectionFailure:    A failure occurred during component detection
             - NoLogic:             No detection logic was available
